# Dissent-Voting <img align="right" src="https://github.com/1Hive/website/blob/master/website/static/img/bee.png" height="80px" />

The dissent-voting app enables organizations to restrict voting to those who have not expressed approval in recent votes. This is achieved through a combination of the [Dandelion Voting](https://github.com/1Hive/dissent-voting-app/tree/master/dandelion-voting) and [Dissent Oracle](https://github.com/1Hive/dissent-voting-app/tree/master/dissent-oracle). Dandelion Voting keeps track of who has voted `yay` or `nay` on each proposal and when that vote took place. The Dissent Oracle then checks whether an account has voted `yay` on a proposal within the time-frame of the dissent-window and returns a boolean expressing that fact. This allows other applications (such as [Redemptions](https://github.com/1Hive/redemptions-app/)) to restrict actions based on the response from the Dissent Oracle.

> Note: The Dissent Oracle and Dandelion Voting applications are meant to be deployed together as the Dissent Oracle will not work on other Aragon voting applications.

## How does it work?

Details on the mechanics of the Dandelion Voting and Dissent Oracle apps can be found in the README of each app:
- [Dandelion Voting README](https://github.com/1Hive/dissent-voting-app/tree/master/dandelion-voting/README.md)
- [Dissent Oracle README](https://github.com/1Hive/dissent-voting-app/tree/master/dissent-oracle/README.md)

## Aragon DAO Installation

Instructions for installation can be found in the README of each application.
